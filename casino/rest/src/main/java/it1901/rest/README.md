# The Rest module

The rest module contains two classes:

- RestApplication.java
- RestController.java

The RestApplication only contains a main method that will start the Springboot server and create a directory in the home directory of the user.

The RestController is the controller of the API. Depending on the request from the RestModel class in the UI-module, the corresponding reponse will be returned.
