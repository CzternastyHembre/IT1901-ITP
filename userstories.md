## Roulette strategies (us-1)

As an eager gambler I would like an application where I could try more roulette strategies without having to use money.  

The user has the need to play roulette where the application is as random as roulette is in real life. The user would like to save their name and be able to come back later to play more. The roulette game has to be similiar to real life with betting different chips in different places to increase the chance to win.
